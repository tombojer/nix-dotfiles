# nix-dotfiles

## Requirements

You need to install Nix using the official installer:

```bash
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

### Homebrew

Some applications need to be installed through homebrew, so we just install it.
* https://brew.sh/

### SOPS for secrets (optional)
If you want to have your secrets decrypted lying in the repository, you need to have you age key located at `/home/<username>/.config/sops/age/keys.txt` (linux) or `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/sops/age/keys.txt` (darwin)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tombojer/nix-dotfiles.git ~/.config/nix-dotfiles
```

2. Initialize the Nix setup with
```bash
nix run nix-darwin -- switch --flake ~/.config/nix-dotfiles
```

3. If you want to apply your changes in the future you need to run
```bash
darwin-rebuild switch --flake ~/.config/nix-dotfiles/ --show-trace
```
 
## MacOS Settings

### Keyboard

I am using the standard german layout, to have the same layout as Windows and Linux.
* Go to "Sytem Settings > Keyboard > Text Input".
* There you can change the layout by clicking on edit.
* Now another window is opening. Click on + in the left side to add another layout.
* Select German and then "German - Standard". Save it.

### Shortcuts

I have swapped my ctrl and cmd key on my external keyboard. You can simply do that aswell.
* Go to "Sytem Settings > Keyboard" and click on "Keyboard Shortcuts...".
* Switch to the "Modifier Keys" tab and select your external keyboard in the top
* Set Control to Command and Command to Control

### Change default shell

You can change your default shell with
```bash
chsh -s <Change this to your shell path which you can find in /etc/shells there is a comment with shells managed by nix> 
```
